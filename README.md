# QIFS - Quantum-Inspired Fluid Simulations
CFD simulations using Tensor Network encoding.
This repository contains the implementations of the Quantum-Inspired CFD Algorithm of the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823
(arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17823)

The algorithm was introduced in this paper by Gourianov et al.:
A quantum-inspired approach to exploit turbulence structures
