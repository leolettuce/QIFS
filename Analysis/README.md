# Analysis
This folder contains the final analysis used for the paper: [insert arXiv link]
- Runtime Analysis
- Memory Analysis
- Chi vs Re Analysis
- Fidelity Analysis
- Energy Spectrum Analysis

Unfortunately, this folder does not contain the raw data from the simulation as these files consume several GB up to TB.
However, the raw data needed for these analyses can be recreated using the python files in "2D_DNS" and "2D_QIS".

Remark: The analysis visible in these files is deprecated and will be updated soon to match the figures in the paper.
