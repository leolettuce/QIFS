# Analysis
This folder contains the final analysis used for the paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.013112

- Runtime Analysis
- Memory Analysis
- Chi vs Re Analysis
- Fidelity Analysis
- Energy Spectrum Analysis

Unfortunately, this folder does not contain all the raw data from the simulation as these files consume several GB. In particular, the data is missing for the energy spectrum analysis.
However, the raw data needed for these analyses can be recreated using the python files in "2D_DNS" and "2D_QIS".
Feel free to contact me in case you need the data (my email can be found in the paper).
